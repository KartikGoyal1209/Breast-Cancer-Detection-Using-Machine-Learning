Breast Cancer Detection Project 

Dataset:The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. It contains 569 samples with 30 features each, including the diagnosis (malignant or benign).  

Steps:
1. Load the Data: Load the dataset from the provided CSV file. 

2. Preprocess the Data: 
- Drop irrelevant columns (`id` and `Unnamed: 32`). 
- Encode the diagnosis column. 
- Standardize the feature columns. 

3. Explore the Data: 
- Visualize the distribution of diagnoses. 
- Generate descriptive statistics for the dataset. 

4. Train-Test Split: 
Split the dataset into training and testing sets. 

5. Train the Model: 
Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data. 

6. Evaluate the Model: 
- Calculate the accuracy score. 
- Generate and interpret the confusion matrix. 

7. Make Predictions: 
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
